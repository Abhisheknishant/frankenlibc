Very small libc for building librumpuser only

Although as we need to run configure, I guess we may as well link in our base libc too...

Ugh in which case, why not explode musl libc.a, and rename symbols in it

Hmm but we do need our ucontext stuff

Could just use parts

Ah yes, we dont want threads, odd stuff, etc.
